# FermiBottle Docker Container

FermiBottle is a Docker container and analysis environment provided by the Fermi Science Support Center. 

For your exercises and analysis we have prepared FermiBottle preloaded with all the software we expect you will need. This will create a separate workspace for you without concern for operating system compatibility. The only dependency is Docker.

[Documentation and getting started instructions are available on the wiki](https://github.com/FermiSummerSchool/FermiBottle/wiki)
