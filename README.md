# THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW DEFUNCT

All future development will occur in the official fermi-lat github organization at https://github.com/fermi-lat/FermiBottle



# FermiBottle Docker Container

FermiBottle is a Docker container and analysis environment provided by the Fermi Science Support Center. 

For your exercises and analysis we have prepared FermiBottle preloaded with all the software we expect you will need. This will create a separate workspace for you without concern for operating system compatibility. The only required dependency is Docker, though X11 is necessary for graphical elements.
